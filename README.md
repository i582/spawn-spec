# Spawn Language Specification

This repository contains the specification of the Spawn programming language,
which describes how parts of the language should function in more detail, as
compared to more traditional user documentation.

The main goal of this specification is to be a single place to describe all
aspects of the language, including syntax, semantics, capabilities, and
limitations. This specification does not attempt to be scientific material, but
rather a description of the language in a language that the reader can
understand.

The specification does not currently describe the entire language, but parts
that are not described will be added gradually.

This repository contains three files:

- [reference.md](reference.md) — the main specification file
- [reference.pdf](reference.pdf) — a PDF version of the specification
- [grammar.bnf](grammar.bnf) — the grammar of the language in BNF form

## Feedback

If you find an error in the specification, have ideas for improving the language
and want to discuss it, or have other questions or want to keep an eye on the
language, please join our Discord server:
